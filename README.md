## Description:
The fifth project of The Odin Project and the final project of the "Foundations" section. A basic calculator that can handle basic arithmetic operations along with error handling and simple quality of ife features, such as rounding decimals so they don't overflow the display.

## Skills:
This project definitely further tested my JavaScript and debugging abilities particularly with ensuring that the user's input was valid. I got a bit more practice with HTML/CSS, FlexBox, and dynamic styling using JavaScript to provide user feedback based on the user's input.

## Reflection:
I feel really confident setting up basic HTML/CSS webpages with some simple user feedback using JavaScript. The main difficulty in this project lay in ensuring that the calculator behaved appropriately given user input, even if that user input was incorrect or unfinished. This was good practice in debugging edge cases such as dividing by zero which I had to consider. I struggled toward the end as I did not implement one aspect of the functionality (resetting if the user inputs a number after evaluating instead of appending to the result) as specified by the project until I completed majority of it. I figured it out eventually, but should have read more carefully through the project specifications before diving into coding it. Definitely a great learning experience and I feel confident that I am solid in the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
